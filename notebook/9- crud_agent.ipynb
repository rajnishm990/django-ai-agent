Here\\'s a summary of the movie \"Mission Impossible\" for your convenience:\\n\\n\"Mission Impossible\" is a 1996 American action spy film directed by Brian De Palma. It is the first installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF).\\n\\nThe plot revolves around Ethan being framed for the murders of his entire team during a mission to retrieve the non-official cover (NOC) list. If exposed, this operation would result in the exposure and death of IMF agents worldwide. With a team of disavowed agents, Ethan must track down and stop the real traitor, Sean Ambrose, while also trying to clear his name.\\n\\nThe film is recognized for its iconic theme music, stunts, and action sequences, including a memorable scene where Tom Cruise\\'s character dangles from the ceiling of a secure room in CIA headquarters.'"
